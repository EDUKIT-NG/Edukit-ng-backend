API Structure:

Use a consistent API structure throughout the application
Use API endpoints that are descriptive and follow a consistent pattern
Use HTTP methods that are appropriate for the action being performed (e.g., POST for creating a new resource, PUT for updating an existing resource)
Use payload validation to ensure that the data being sent is valid and consistent
Use error handling to handle unexpected errors and provide useful error messages
Best Practices:

Use authentication and authorization to secure API endpoints
Use rate limiting to prevent abuse of API endpoints
Use caching to improve performance and reduce the load on the server
Use logging and monitoring to track API usage and identify issues
Use testing to ensure that API endpoints are working correctly and catch any bugs or issues
API Documentation:

Use API documentation tools like Swagger or API Blueprint to document API endpoints
Include information about API endpoints, including the endpoint URL, HTTP method, payload, and response
Include examples of API requests and responses
Use clear and concise language to describe API endpoints and their usage

Suggestions for improvement:

Refactor code duplication: Refactor the code to eliminate duplication and make it more maintainable.
Add comments: Add comments to explain the purpose and behavior of each API endpoint.
Standardize API endpoint naming: Standardize the API endpoint naming conventions to make it easier to understand the purpose of each endpoint.
Create API documentation: Create API documentation to explain the purpose and behavior of each API endpoint.
Address security vulnerabilities: Address potential security vulnerabilities, such as storing passwords in plain text, to make the API more secure.

Best practices:

Follow the single responsibility principle: Each API endpoint should have a single responsibility and should not be responsible for multiple tasks.
Use dependency injection: Use dependency injection to make the code more modular and easier to test.
Use a consistent coding style: Use a consistent coding style throughout the code to make it easier to read and understand.
Test the code: Test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected and to catch any bugs or issues.
Use a version control system: Use a version control system, such as Git, to track changes to the code and to collaborate with other developers.


URL resources are nouns {/users, /students} and HTTP methods are verbs {GET, POST, PUT, UPDATE, DELETE}
